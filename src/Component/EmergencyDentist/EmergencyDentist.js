              <h3>CENTRAL COAST EMERGENCY DENTIST</h3>
              <p>
                As life often dictates, unexpected emergencies pop up when you
                least want them to! Sudden toothaches can be very painful,
                sometimes even unbearable. They can hit you at the worst times
                like on the weekend, late at night, or during a vacation. At
                Luminous Dentistry we offer a full range of central coast
                emergency dentist options. Let’s look at possible causes of a
                dental emergency.

              <h3> EMERGENCY TOOTHACHE SYMPTOMS AND TOOTHPAIN</h3>
              <p>
                Call our office if you’re experiencing any of the following:
              </p>
              <li>Hot and extreme cold sensitivity on teeth</li>
              <li>Sensitivity to sweets</li>
              <li>
                Swelling of the gum around the tooth, or swelling that is
                starting to spread to the face
              </li>
              <li>Sharp or dull pain near your tooth</li>
              <li>Pain that radiates into the ear</li>
              <li>Lingering discomfort after eating or drinking</li>
              <li>Pain that awakens you from sleep</li> <li>Fever</li>
              <li>Sore or bleeding gums</li>
              <li>
                Gum boil, fistula or a pimple on your gums (You may or may not
                notice it draining fluid.)
              </li>
              <li>
                Bad taste in the mouth, which may be caused from an infected
                tooth.
              </li>
              <p>
                On a more serious note, an infection that starts in your tooth
                can enter your bloodstream, leading to a number of other
                problems. Please don’t wait too long to address something that
                seems as simple as a toothache! If you do experience severe
                swelling, high fever, or trouble swallowing, you may need
                immediate attention and should go to the nearest emergency room.
                For all other dental emergencies, it’s best to seek out
                immediate dental care.

              <h3> COMMON EMERGENCY TOOTHACHE CAUSES</h3>
              <p>

                developing a toothache at any time. By seeing us as soon as
                possible, we can make recommendations for treatment before it
                turns into something more severe and difficult to deal with.

              <h3>HOW TO MANAGE A TOOTHACHE AT NIGHT</h3>
              <p>
                Many toothache sufferers tell us that the pain worsens at night.
                To relieve this situation, you could do one or more of the
                following:
              </p>
              <li>
                Brush and floss your teeth before bed to ensure that no food
                particles are left around the sore tooth.
              </li>
              <li>
                Mix a warm salt water solution and swish gently with it. This
                can actually be done several times a day and has better soothing
                qualities compared to the average mouthwash.
              </li>
              <li>
                Over the counter anti-inflammatory medication such as ibuprofen
                and naproxen sodium are great toothache pain relievers.
              </li>
              <li>
                Place a cold compress over the sore area on the outside of the
                cheek for about 15 minutes. A frozen bag of peas works well.
                This will help numb the area a bit. DO NOT USE A HOT COMPRESS,
                as heat can make the area swell.
              </li>
              <li>
                Sleep with your head elevated so that blood doesn’t rush to your
                head, causing pressure to build up, worsening the pain
              </li>
            </div>
            <div className='info'>
              <h3>TOOTHACHE PAINKILLERS AND OTHER MEDICATION</h3>
              <p>
                If your dental infection is severe, then over the counter
                anti-inflammatory pain medications will not suffice. You will
                need to see a dentist in order to be prescribed appropriate
                medication and treat the source of the pain. An antibiotic such
                as amoxicillin may be administered along with a pain reliever as
                necessary. Once the antibiotic takes effect, which may be a few
                days, the pain will subside in most cases. If you are allergic
                to amoxicillin or penicillin, there are other antibiotics
                available that will target the bacteria caused by a toothache.
                These may include clindamycin (cleocin) or erythromycin
                (azithromycin). Please be sure to let us know if you are
                allergic to certain medications so we can provide you with the
                proper prescriptions.

              <h3>HOW DO YOU GET RID OF A TOOTHACHE?</h3>
              <p>
                You won’t be able to cure a true toothache completely on your
                own. When the nerve inside your tooth has become infected, there
                are only one to two options to treat the problem. Our dentist
                can provide you with the proper diagnosis and treatment. In most
                cases, the recommendation will be something like a filling,
                crown, root canal, or deep scaling (for gum disease.) As long as
                enough healthy tooth structure is present, we will try to
                preserve your natural tooth rather than extract it. For
                extensive decay or abscesses, a root canal may be best. During
                this procedure our dentist will remove the nerve tissue,
                disinfect the hollow canals, and place a sealer inside to
                prevent bacteria from re-entering the tooth. Proper removal of
                the nerve tissue will ensure the best outcome for a pain-free
                smile.

              <h3>CENTRAL COAST EMERGENCY DENTIST</h3>
              <p>
                We recommend seeing us for regular check-ups to reduce your risk
                of dental emergencies. Through frequent examinations and
                periodic X-rays, our Central Coast dentist can screen for issues
                that may require attention as soon as possible, before they get
                worse or becomes painful. If you are experiencing a dental
                emergency, we invite you to call our Central Coast dental
                office. Home remedies and over the counter medication may help
                subside the pain and inflammation but it will repeatedly return
                unless cared for by a professional. At Luminous Dentistry, we’re
                always ready for your dental emergency, even if you aren’t.
                We’re open late during the week to assist you, and on Saturdays
                by appointment. Any surgical or invasive procedure carries
                risks. Before proceeding, you should seek a second opinion from
                an appropriately qualified health practitioner.
